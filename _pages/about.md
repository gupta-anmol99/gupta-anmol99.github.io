<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hey! I am a second year PhD student at Arizona State University working at the [Logos Lab](https://logos-robotics-lab.github.io/) advised by [Dr. Nakul Gopalan](https://nakulgopalan.github.io/). My research focuses on developing robots that can reason about the world by learning generalizable models.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Bhopal, India, in 2021, and my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University in 2022. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer at e2Serv Technologies in India.

Outside the lab, I enjoy reading and playing video games. I'm a big fan of high fantasy and sci-fi novels, and I especially enjoy open-world games and RPGs.
