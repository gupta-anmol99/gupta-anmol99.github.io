Hey! I am a second year PhD student at Arizona State University working at the [Logos Lab](https://logos-robotics-lab.github.io/) advised by [Dr. Nakul Gopalan](https://nakulgopalan.github.io/). My research focuses on developing robots that can reason about the world by learning generalizable models.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Bhopal, India, in 2021, and my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University in 2022. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer at e2Serv Technologies in India.

Outside the lab, I enjoy reading and playing video games. I'm a big fan of high fantasy and sci-fi novels, and I especially enjoy open-world games and RPGs.
